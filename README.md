👋 Hi, I'm George!

I’m an Administrative Developer—building internal tools, automating workflows, and solving real-world problems with clean, functional code. I work primarily with Django and enjoy creating practical web applications that make everyday tasks easier.

🛠 I build tools that streamline operations and improve productivity.

🔍 Currently exploring prompt engineering, AI integrations, and smart internal systems.

🚀 Let’s collaborate and build something meaningful.
